Introduction to Apache ActiveMQ
1. classic RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) is considered tightly coupled

2. loose coupling throughout a system can lead to EDA (Event-Driven Architecture)

3. SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture), whose backbone is using a service for a specific task

4. brew installed activemq location:
    /usr/local/Cellar/activemq/5.13.3

5. JMS,
    it is not a MOM (Message-Oriented Middleware),
    It is an API that abstracts the interaction between messaging clients

6. concepts:
  6.1 JMS producer: a client application that creates and sends JMS messages.
  6.2 JMS provider: the implementation of the JMS interfaces, which is ideally written in 100% pure Java
  6.3 JMS domains: the two styles of messaging that include "point-to-point" and "publish/subscribe"
  6.4 JMS client: an application is written using 100% pure Java to send and receive messages.
  6.5 Non-JMS client: an application is written using the JMS provider's native client API to send and receive messages instead of JMS
  6.6 JMS consumer: a client application that receives and processes JMS messages.
  6.7 JMS message: the most fundamental concept of JMS; sent and received by JMS clients
  6.8 administrative object: preconfigured JMS objects that contain provider-specific configuration data for use by clients.
                             These objects are typically accessible by client via JNDI
  6.9 connection factory: clients use a connection factory to create connections to the JMS provider
  6.10 destination: an object to which messages are addressed and sent and from which messages are received.

7. The MessageConsumer can consume messages either synchronously by using one of the receive() methods,
   or asynchronously by providing a MessageListener implementation to the consumer.
   The MessageListener.onMessage() method is invoked as messages arrive on the destination.
   Note:
    there is no method for setting the destination on the MessageConsumer.
    Instead the destination is set when the consumer is created using the Session.createConsumer()

8. Headers set automatically by the client's send() method:
  8.1 JMSDestination, destination to which the message is being sent
  8.2 JMSDeliveryMode,
    8.2.1 persistent:
            default, advises the JMS provider to persist the message.
            message will not be lost if the provider fails.
            A JMS provider must deliver a persistent message once and only once
    8.2.2 nonpersistent:
            instructs the JMS provider not t persist the message.
            if the JMS provider fails, the message may be lost,
            but it won't be delivered twice.
  8.3 JMSExpiration,
        The time that a message will expire. (in milliseconds)
        default is 0, which has a special meaning of never expire.
  8.4 JMSMessageID,
        a string that uniquely identifies a message that's assigned by the JMS provider and must begin with ID.
        The message ID can be used for message processing or for history purpose in a message storage mechanism.
        It can also be turned of
  8.5 JMSPriority,
        used to assign a level of importance to a message.
  8.6 JMSTimestamp,
        denotes the time the message was sent by the producer to the JMS provider.
  8.7 JMSCorrelationId
        Used to associate the current message with a previous message.
        This header is commonly used to associate a response message with a request message.
        The value of the JMSCorrelationID can be one of the following:
        8.7.1 a provider-specific message ID
        8.7.2 an application-specific String
        8.7.3 a provider-native byte[] value
  8.9 JMSReplyTo
        used to specify a destination where a reply should be sent.
        commonly used for request/reply style messaging
  8.10 JMSType
        used to semantically identify the message type.
        has nothing to do with the payload Java type of the message
  8.11 JMSRedelivered,
        used to indicate the liklihood that a message was previously delivered but not acknowledged.

9. JMS message properties
    they are simply additional headers that can be specified on a message.
    9.1 Custom properties
    9.2 JMS-defined properties
    9.3 provider specific properties

10. JMS domains
  10.1 point-to-point domain,
        similar to "email system",
        message destination is "queue"
        one message is delivered from one producer to one consumer, and only once
  10.2 publish/subscribe domain
        message destination is "topic"
        any message sent to the topic are automatically delivered to all subscribers
