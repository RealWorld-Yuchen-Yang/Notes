Getting started with jquery
1. $(),
    is equal to jQuery(),
    its whole job is grabbing the elements you put into the parentheses
    the inputs can be three types:
    1.1 CSS selectors,
          jQuery will return you the set of elements that match that selector
    1.2 HTML,
          if you put a string of HTML, you can add DOM elements to the browser on the fly
    1.3 Javascript Object

2. CSS selectors
  2.1 element selectorï¼š
        syntax: HTML element
        e.g. h1, which represents header1
  2.2 class selector:
        syntax .class
        e.g.
          .my_class
          div.my_class, selects only the **divs** that have the **my_class** class
  2.3 ID selector:
        syntax: #ID
        e.g. #my_id
  2.4 Descendent selector:
        syntax: parent child grandChild ...
        e.g. div p

  Note: in CSS, selectors select elements to add **style** to those elements
        in jQuery, selectors select elements to add **behavior** to those elements

3. jQuery statements should end with ';'

Selectors and methods: Grab and go
1. <script> tag is better to be written in end of <body>,
   because this style will not hinder the browser from parallel download images,
   which increase performance

2. structure, style, and script
   for an element,
   it defines its **structure** in HTML,
   further has its style configured in CSS,
   and finally get its behavior configured in Javascript/its corresponding libraries (like jQuery)

3. you can write Javascript inside jQuery function.
   after all, jQuery is just a Javascript library

4. '*', is a wildcard in jQuery which represents all the elements in the DOM

5. $(this),
    represents the current element
    it is context-dependent,
    one of the best place to use it is within a function that runs when a jQuery method is called.
    Note:
      this,
        is a Javascript reference to the DOM element we want to work with
        by wrapping it with $(), we can use it with jQuery methods

6. Using DOM inspectors, like Chrome Developer tools or Firebug for Firefox,
   should show you the DOM as it is displayed on the page
   (which is after Javascript manipulation, if there is any)

7. jQuery methods:
    reusable codes defined in the jQuery library.
  7.1 .append,
        inserts the specified content into the DOM.
  7.2 .remove,
        takes elements out of the DOM.
