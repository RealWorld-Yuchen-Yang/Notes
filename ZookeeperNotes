Zookeeper Basics
1. Recipes: implementation of primitives.

2. znodes: small data nodes, they are organized hierarchically as a tree. just like a file system.
  2.1 The absence of data often conveys important information about a znode.
  2.2 /workers znode, parent znode to all znodes representing a worker available in the system
  2.3 /tasks znode, is the parent of all tasks created and waiting for workers to execute them.
  2.4 /assign znode is the parent of all znodes representing an assignment of a task to a worker.

3. znode mode options:
  3.1 persistent
  3.2 ephemeral
  3.3 persistent_sequential
  3.4 ephemeral_sequential
