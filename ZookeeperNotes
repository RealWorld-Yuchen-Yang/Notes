Zookeeper Basics
1. Recipes: implementation of primitives.

2. znodes: small data nodes, they are organized hierarchically as a tree. just like a file system.
  2.1 The absence of data often conveys important information about a znode.
  2.2 /workers znode, parent znode to all znodes representing a worker available in the system
  2.3 /tasks znode, is the parent of all tasks created and waiting for workers to execute them.
  2.4 /assign znode is the parent of all znodes representing an assignment of a task to a worker.

3. znode mode options:
  3.1 persistent
  3.2 ephemeral
  3.3 persistent_sequential
  3.4 ephemeral_sequential

4. For the quorum of servers, we should always shoot for an odd number,
   It this way can we tolerate more crashes of servers

5. My Zookeeper's installation directory
   /usr/local/Cellar/zookeeper/3.4.9/bin

6. Client: add tasks to the system
   Once the task znode is created, the master observes the event
   The master next checks the new task, get a list of available workers, and assign assignments to workers
