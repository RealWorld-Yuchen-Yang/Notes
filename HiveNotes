Introduction
1. Hive provides an SQL dialect, called Hive Query Language (HiveQL or just HQL)
   It is used for querying data stored in a Hadoop cluster.

2. The biggest limitation is that Hive does not provide record-level update, insert, nor delete.

3. Hive does not provide transactions, which is the crucial feature of OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)

4. OLAP's online means "short in response time"
   Hive is closer to being an OLAP tool, but less responsive.

5. If you need OLTP features for large-scale data,
   you should consider using a NoSQL database,
   Examples include HBase, a NoSQL database integrated with Hadoop,
   Casandra, and DynamoDB, if you are using Amazon's Elastic MapReduce (EMR) or Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
