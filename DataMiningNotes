Data Mining Notes
Data Warehousing and Online Analytical Processing
1. Differences between Operational Database Systems and Data Warehouses
  1.1 OLTP (Online transaction processing), traditional RDBMS
        is customer-oriented
  1.2 OLAP (Online analytical processing)
        is market-oriented

2. OLAP Operations
  2.1. Roll-up
    performs aggregation on a data cube.
    either by climbing up a concept hierarchy for a dimension or by dimension reduction

  2.2. Drill-down
      navigates from less detailed data to more detailed data.
      drill-down can be realized by either stepping down a concept hierarchy for a dimension
      or introducing additional dimensions

  2.3. Slice and dice:
      the slice operation performs a selection on one dimension of the given cube, resulting in a subcube
      the dice operation defines a subcube by performing a selection on two or more dimensions

  2.4. Pivot
        also called rotate,
        is a visualization operation,
        that rotates the data axes in view to provide an alternative data presentation

3. three kinds of data warehouse applications:
  3.1 information processing
  3.2 analytical processing
  3.3 data mining
