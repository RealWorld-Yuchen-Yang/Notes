Data Mining Notes
Introduction
1. Iterative steps of data mining
  1.1 Data cleaning (to remove noise and inconsistent data)
  1.2 Data integration (where multiple data sources may be combined)
  1.3 Data selection (where data relevant to the analysis task are retrieved from the database)
  1.4 Data transformation (where data are transformed and consolidated into forms appropriate for mining by performing summary or aggregation operations)
  1.5 Data mining (an essential process where intelligent methods are applied to extract data patterns)
  1.6 Pattern evaluation (to identify the truly interesting patterns representing knowledge based on interestingness measures)
  1.7 Knowledge presentation (where visualization and knowledge representation techniques are used to present mined knowledge to users)

2. ER (entity-relationship) data model

3. Data warehouse
  3.1 Definition
    a repository of information collected from multiple sources,
    stored under a unified schema,
    and usually residing at a single site.
  3.2 data warehouse is modeled by data cube
    3.2.1 dimension
          corresponds to an attribute or a set of attributes in the schema
    3.2.2 cell
          stores the value of some aggregate measure
          e.g.
            count, sum

4. class/concept description can be derived from
  4.1 data characterization
        summarizing the data of the class under study (often called target class) in general terms
  4.2 data discrimination
        comparison of the target class with one or a set of comparative classes (often called  the contrasting classes)
  Note: User Profile is an implementation of such class/concept description

5. Association (Frequent Patterns)
  5.1 support: the percentage of a particular pattern in the whole records
                support(X => Y) = P(X U Y)
                rules < support usually considered uninteresting
  5.2 confidence: the certainty of such pattern appears given a particular predicate
                confidence(X => Y) = P(Y | X)
                rules < confidence usually referred as noise

6. Classification
    the process of finding a  model that describes and distinguishes data classes or concepts
  6.1 model
    6.1.1 data objects whose class labels are known
    6.1.2 it is used to predict the class label of objects for which the class label is unknown
    6.1.3 presentation
            classification rules, decision trees, mathematical formulae, neural networks

7. regression
    models continuous-valued functions

8. Cluster analysis
    unlike classification and regression,
    which analyze class-labeled (training) data sets,
    clustering analyzes data objects without consulting class labels
    clustering can be used to generate "labels"

Data Warehousing and Online Analytical Processing
1. Differences between Operational Database Systems and Data Warehouses
  1.1 OLTP (Online transaction processing), traditional RDBMS
        is customer-oriented
  1.2 OLAP (Online analytical processing)
        is market-oriented

2. OLAP Operations
  2.1. Roll-up
    performs aggregation on a data cube.
    either by climbing up a concept hierarchy for a dimension or by dimension reduction

  2.2. Drill-down
      navigates from less detailed data to more detailed data.
      drill-down can be realized by either stepping down a concept hierarchy for a dimension
      or introducing additional dimensions

  2.3. Slice and dice:
      the slice operation performs a selection on one dimension of the given cube, resulting in a subcube
      the dice operation defines a subcube by performing a selection on two or more dimensions

  2.4. Pivot
        also called rotate,
        is a visualization operation,
        that rotates the data axes in view to provide an alternative data presentation

3. three kinds of data warehouse applications:
  3.1 information processing
  3.2 analytical processing
  3.3 data mining
