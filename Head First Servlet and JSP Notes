Chapter1 Why use Servlet and JSPs: an introduction
1. **htdocs** is the directory that is the root for all of the server's web application
2. **Web Server** only serves **static page**
3. **Web Application** can server **Dynamically Created page**,
   such created page will be sent to the server so as to get served to the client
   Note: Diynamic means that the page does not exist before the client's request
4. Also it is the web application's responsibility to communicate with the db, instead of the server
5. web.xml is called the DD(deployment descriptor)
sample:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8851-1" ?>
<web-app
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
    xmlns:web="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_2_5.xsd"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee
http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_2_5.xsd"
  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>Chapter1 Servlet</servlet-name><!--ties the servlet element to the servlet mapping element-->
    <servlet-class>Ch1Servlet</servlet-class><!--servlet's java class-->
  </servlet>

  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>Chapter1 Servlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/Serv1</url-pattern><!--the url name that the client uses for the request, "/" is the context root-->
  </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>

6. Manual compile project command:
  javac -classpath /TOMCAT_DIR/tomcat/common/lib/servlet-api.jar -d classes src/SERVLET1.java

7. For a servlet SERVLET1 on a web application APP1, the Tomcat deployment structure should be:
/TOMCAT_DIRECTORY/webapps/APP1/WEB-INF/classes/PACKAGE_NAME/SERVLET1.class
                                      /web.xml

and the corresponding launch directory is
http://localhost:8080/APP1/SERVLET1

8. JSP = Java inside HTML
   Note: by using tag <%= JAVA CODES %>

Chapter2. Web App Architecture: high-level Overview
1. Apache is a web server
2. Tomcat is a web container, where servlets should be deployed
3. Container's support
  Communication Support: between web server and web app
  Lifecycle Management
  Multithreading Support: servlet's life and death, but it does not guarantee thread safety
  Declarative Security: Manage and change security without touching and recompiling Java source files
  JSP Support: translate JSP(Java inside HTML) code into real Java
4. URL can be a link to a static page, or a link to a servlet
5. One servlet has three names:
  Client-known URL name **<url-pattern>**: the name written in HTML, which will be included in the HTTP request, logical
  Deployer-known secret internal name **<servlet-name>**: known only to the deployer/others in the real operational environment, logical
  Actual file name **<servlet-class>**: the servlet class's full-qualified name, includes className and packageName
    path to the servlet is the package directory structure lives on the server

6. MVC(Modle-View-Controller)
  Controller(Servlet) -- > View (JSP)
                      -- > Model(POJO, Plain Old Java Object) -- > DB
7. A J2EE application server includes both a web container and an EJB Container
   web container: manages Servlet and JSP
   EJB container: manages Enterprise JavaBeans(business object)

   Stand alone web container: Tomcat (open source), usually used together with web server Apache
   J2EE Server(webContainer+EJBContainer): JBoss (open source)

Chapter3. Mini MVC Tutorail: hands-in MVC
1. Development environment
/PROJECT_NAME: can have multiple apps
  /APP_NAME/
    /etc: contains configuration files, e.g. **web.xml**
    /lib: 3rd party JAR files
    /web: contains view components
          both dynamic(.jsp) and static(.html)
    /src: java code
      /packages: reversed company url, e.g. com.example
        /web: contains controller java files(Servlets)
        /model: contains model java files(java beans)
    /classes: contains compiled and copied over .class files
      sub directory is the same as /src


2. Deployment environment
Deploying a web app involves both Container-specific rules and requirements of the servlets and JSP specifications
(Here, we are conforming Tomcat container)
****************************
Tomcat specific:
/TOMCAT_HOME/
  /webapps
    /APP_NAME: also represents the "context root", which Tomcat uses when resolving URLs
****************************
Servlet and JSP specific: the following is container independent
      /: contains view components both dynamic(.jsp) and static(.html), same contents as /web directory during development
      /WEB-INF
        /web.xml: Deployment Descriptor
        /lib: 3rd party jars
        /classes: .class files, same substructure as its corresponding src directory in the development environment
                  one exception is when deploying .class files in a JAR
****************************

3. Conclude developmen steps(iterative development):
  iterate
  {
    1. build and test HTML
    2. build and test version1 of the controller servlet
    3. build a test class for "model" class(model's unit tests)
       ,build and test model
    5. upgrade the servlet to version2, link the "servlet" with the "model"
    6. build the JSP(respond page to the user)
  }

4. Complile the servlet
under the development project root:
javac -classpath /Applications/apache-tomcat-9.0.0.M9/lib/servlet-api.jar:classes:. -d classes  src/com/example/web/BeerSelect.java

5. Servlet pass the computation result to its corresponding JSP page by using the request object
   JSP page have reference to the request, from which it can retrieve the result passed from the servlet

6. We do not need to compile the JSP page, however, the container does that at first request

Chapter4: Being a Servlet: request and response
1. **HttpServletRequest** is used to:
    1.1 retrieve HTML form parameters
    1.2 retrieve HTML request header
    1.3 retrieve cookie
2. **HttpServletResponse** is used to:
    2.1 set HTTP response header
    2.2 set response content
    2.3 redirect to another URL
    2.4 add cookie to response
3. Purpose and event sequence of servlet lifecycle:
    3.1 servlet class loading
    3.2 servlet instantiation
    3.3 call init()
    3.4 call service()
    3.5 call destroy()

4. Servlet is singleton. Each JVM can have only one servlet instance for each servlet class
   However, the servlet container allocates one thread, inside which servlet is manipulated, for each client request

5. ServletConfig and ServletContext
ServeltConfig:
  one SerletConfig boject per servlet
  use it to access ServletContext
  Configured in Deployment Descriptor

ServletContext:
  One ServeltContext per web app.(Actually is AppContext)
  it is used to access web app parameters, also configured in Deployment Descriptor

6. doGet() method in Servlet should be idempotent,
  means we should design it in a way such that each time calling this method will not cause negative side effects on the server

7. On HTML, how to determine a request is get/post
  7.1 a simple hyperlink(marked by <a>) always means a get
  7.2 if you specify a form's method as POST, then it is a post
  7.3 form's default action is GET

8. If we want to support both GET and POST from a single servlet
   developers usually put real logic in doGet(),
   then let doPost() call doGet()

9. the servlet's getServerPort(), getLocalPort(), getRemotePort()
  **getRemotePort()**'s remote means the client, since currently I am on the server side
  **getServerPort()**, returns the port the request originally come at.
  **getLocalPort()**, return the port that the request End-up.
  Note:
    the reason that request in some cases are redirected is because
    in this way the app can handle multiple client at the same time
10.I should always set the contentType first in the response object,
   then I can do other operations like writing to the output stream

11. meaning of redirect and dispatch
    redirect（browser does the work）:
      When the response from the servlet is a redirect,
      it is the browser who will send a new request to the new URL
      so in this way, the URL on the browser address bar will change

    redirect 可以到绝对的URL： http://www.xxx.com/APP_NAME/PATH
             也可以到相对的URL，container开到相对的URL后， 会自动补齐缺失的http://www.XXX.com这一部分
             有两种相对的URL， 不以'/'开头的， 和以'/'开头的
                不以'/'开头的： 表示URL是相对当前Servlet URL-Pattern所在的directory
                以'/'开头的： 表示相对网络应用的根目录的directory， 即container将URL补齐后应该为http://www.xxx.com/APP_NAME/DIRECTORY
             记住， 永远都是先redirect， 再往response里写东西， 顺序反了不行
    dispatch (server does the work):
      servlet decide that the request should go to another part of the webapp,
      since the browser gets the response in the usual way,
      the location in the browser address bar does not change

12. The most commonly used response methods are: setContentType() and getWriter()

Chapter5: Being a Web App: attributes and listeners
1. Both servletConfig and servletContext are init parameters,
   we should think of these init parameters as deploy-time constants
   you can get them at runtime, but you can't set them.
2. ServletContext is actually a dictionary, which I can store a string as a key and store any type object/value as the value
3. I can getInitParameters from the servletContext, type string
     can get/setAttributes in the servletContext, type object
4. After ServletContext is initialized,
   Container creates a new instance of MyServletContextListener Class(which is defined in web.xml)
   Container calls the listener's contextInitialized() method, passing a new ServletContextEvent
   The event object has a reference to the ServletContext, so the event handling code can get the context from the event.
   and get the context init parameter from the context(which is initialized when the ServletContext is created)

5. Where there's a lifecycle moment, there's usually a listener to hear about it.
   Besides context events, you can listen for events related to context attributes, servlet requests and attributes,
   and HTTP sessions and session attributes.

6. Three scopes:
  Context
  Session
  Request

7. To prevent multiple clients accessing the context attribute at the same time,
   instead of locking(synchronizing) the servlet method,
   it is more practical to synchronize the context itself
   which is implemented in doGet()/doPost() as **synchronized(getServletContext)

8. Session is not thread safe either,
   for users can access the same session by using different browser windows.
   To protect the session attributes, we should synchronize on the HttpSession

9. SingleThreadMode(Deprecated) is designed to protect instance variables
  you are guaranteed by the container that only one thread will execute  the servlet's service() method
  To declare a servlet as single thread mode, I should mark it to implement the SingleThreadMode interface
  However, depends on whether the container uses queuling/polling servlets, the thread safety is not guaranteed

10. What does single instance servlet mean??
    each servlet class is has only one instance which is created at deployment time
    this servlet instance is managed by the container and shared among requests

11. Only Request attribute and local variables are thread safe
    so do not assign request or session scoped data as servlet instance variables, but just as method local variables

12. ReqeuestDispatcher
    The servlet asks the HttpRequest for a RequestDispatcher,
    passing in a relative path to the view JSP

    request.setAttribute("key", valueObject);//constructing the request, adding data into it
    RequestDispatcher view = request.getRequestDispatcher("result.jsp");//get the view dispatcher
    view.forward(request, response);//forward the request & response to the view

13. RequestDispatcher can be gotten from ServletRequest or ServletContext,
    From ServletRequest, the forwarding path can be either absolute or relative to the original request
    From ServletContext, the forwarding path has to be absolute

14. Attribute scopes:

    ServletContext:
      thread safety: not thread safe,
      accessibility:  any part of the app can see it
                      including servlets, JSPs, ServletContextListeners, ServletContextAttributeListeners
      scope: same as the life of the deployed app.
      good for: Resources you want the entire application to share,
                including database connection, JNDI lookup, names, email address, etc.

    HttpSession:
      thread safety: not thread safe
      accessibility: Any servlet or JSP with access to this particular session.
                     can span multiple requests by the same client.
                     requests by the same client could go to different servlets
      scope: can be destroyed programmatically or simply time-out
      good for: data and resources related to this client's session,
                something that requires an ongoing conversation with the client.
                e.g. A shopping cart

   Request:
     thread safety: thread safe
     accessibility: any part of the application that has direct access to the Request object.
                    mostly means only the servlets and JSPs to which the request is forwarded using a RequestDispatcher
                    Also Request-related listeners.
     scope: the life of the request,
            which means until the Servlet's service() method completes.
            life of the thread handling this request
     good for: passing model info from the controller to the view,
               or any other data specific to a single client request
               e.g. query parameters

15. in servlet's service() method,
    an IllegalStateException is caused when a response has already been committed(flush, write, etc.)
    to the client

chapter6: Conversational state, session management
1. cookie contains session id, which is created by the container on the first request, and it is behind the scene
2. how to get/generate the session: HttpSession session = request.getSession();
3. An alternative way of getting the session is from the SessionEvent passed in the SessionEvent listener
4. If the client disabled cookie, it will never send back the sessionId (which supposed to be in the cookie)
   the fall back solution is URL rewriting,
   Syntax: URL+;jsessionid=XXXXX
   , which sticks the session to the end of URL
   stripping off the extra part of the URL is done by the container
5. URL rewriting kicks in only if cookies fail, and only if you tell the response to encode the URL
6. I should use Servlet API to manipulate cookie,
   cookie is a Cookie[] array list, instead of a hashMap,
   in order to get one cookie's value, I have to loop through the list
7. SessionBindingListener listens the change of session attributes,
   instead of the life cycle event of a session
   we do not declare it in the web.xml,
   instead, we let the desired attribute class to implement the HttpSessionBindingListener

8. In a distributed environment, where there are multiple JVMs
   Only **HttpSession objects(and their attributes) move from one VM to another.
   There is one ServletContext per VM
   There is one ServletConfig per Servlet，per VM
   but there is only one HttpSession Object for a given session ID per web app,
   regardless of how many VM's the app is distributed across.

9. A session whose timeout period has been set to -1 will never expire

Chapter7: Being a JSP: using JSP
1. A directive is a way for you to give special instructions to the container at page translation time.
   there are three flavors: page, include, taglib
2. page directive: <%@ page import="foo.*, bar.*" %>

3. differnt jsp syntaxes
 3.1 Scriptlet, normal java code, <% %>
 3.2 Directvie, container translation instructions, <%@ %>
 3.3 Expression, prints out result between tags, <%= %>, note there is no tailing ";"

4. All scriptlet and expression code lands in a service() method in the translated servlet
  That means varialbes declared in a scriptlet are always Local variables

5. The jsp generated(by Tomcat container) servlet is in directory:
   /TOMCAT_HOME/work/Catalina/SERVER_NAME/WEB_APP_NAME/org/apache/jsp
   e.g. /Applications/apache-tomcat-9.0.0.M9/work/Catalina/localhost/manager/org/apache/jsp/WEB_002dINF/jsp

6. JSP Declarations: <%! %>, note in the tag, ";" should be pended in the end
   Declarations are for declaring members(variables & methods) of generated servlet class
   this is added outside the generated service() method,
   which means you can declare both static variables and methods

7. in the jsp generated servlet, we should also care about the servlet life cycle methods
   jspInit(), _jspService, jspDestroy(),
   and you can override jspInit() & jspDestroy()

8. Comments:
   HTML Comment: <!-- -->
   JSP Comment: <%-- --%>

9.  configure the servlet init parameters for JSP files:
      also configure them in the web.xml file
      the only difference is that adding an additional element <jsp-file> into the <servlet> element

10. Jsp Implicit Objects has 4 scopes:
      request, session, application and page
    (
      Note:
      1. Servlet only has the previous 3 scopes: request, session, application
      2. You usually won't need(or care about) page scope unless you're developing custom tags.
    )

    JSP implicit Objects:
    API                            Implicit Object
    JspWriter                      out
    HttpServletRequest             request
    HttpServletResponse            response
    HttpSession                    session
    ServletContext                 application
    ServletConfig                  config
    Throwable                      exception
    PageContext                    pageContext

    Note: **PageContext** encapsulates other implicit objects,
          If you give some helper object  a PageContext reference,
          the helper can use that reference to
          get reference to the other implicit objects and attributes from all scopes

11. Over the generated jspInit() method, in the jsp file:
    <%! //note override the jspInit() method using a declaration
      public void jspInit()
      {
          //inside this method, the ServletConfig and ServletContext are all already initialized
      }
    %>

12. Three types of directives:
    12.1 page directive: defines page-specific properties
      e.g. <%@  page import="foo.*" session="false" %>
    12.2 taglib directive: defines tag libraries available to the JSP
      e.g. <%@ taglib tagdir="/WEB-INF/tags/XXX" prefix="XXX" %>
    12.3 include directive: defines text and code that gets added into the current page
      e.g. <%@ include file="XXX.html" %>
      This lets you build reusable chunks(like a standard page heading or navigation bar)
      that can be added to each page without having to duplicate all that code in each JSP

  13. It is bad to write Java code in JSP,
      to avoid this, we should write EL in the JSP pages and use it to call Java method somewhere else.
      JSP EL syntax: ${ }

  14. page directive have higher priority than the web.xml

  15. There are six types of JSP elements:
      scriptlets, directives, declarations, Java expressions, EL and actions

      Actions:
        standard actions: e.g. <jsp:include page="xxx.jsp" />
        Other actions: e.g. <c:set var="rate" value=32 />

Chapter8. Script-free pages: scriptless JSP
1. Implicit EL varialbes:
  pageScope, requestScope, sessionScope, applicationScope,
  param, paramValues,
  header, headerValues,
  cookies, initParam
  pageContext

2. Standard Actions dealing with beans, with attributes: 'id', 'scope', 'type', 'class':
  **jsp:useBean**, used to declare and initialize the actual bean object you are using in <jsp:get/setProperty>
      e.g. **<jsp:useBean id="person" type="foo.Person" class="foo.Employee" scope="request" />**,
           id: declares the identifier for the bean object,
               This corresponds to the **name** used when the servlet code said:
               request.setAttribute("person", p)
      Note:
        1. <jsp:useBean> will create a bean if the one requested does not exist
        2. with a <jsp:useBean> body, you can have code that runs conditionally
           Only if the bean attribute can't be found and a new bean is created
        3. **class attribute**:
             the real bean type
           **type attribute**:
             optional, used to declare the bean's reference type,
             can be classes|interfaces in the higher hierarchy of the inheritance chain
             if type attribute is not specified, the bean reference will be the same as real type,
             which is defined by "class attribute"

  **jsp:getProperty**
    e.g. <jsp:getProperty name="person" property="name" />
        name: identifies the actual bean object,
              this will **match the "id" value** from the <jsp:useBean> tag
        property: identifies the property we would like to get from the JavaBean
  **jsp:setProperty**

3. Standard Actions:
  3.1 jsp:include
  3.2 jsp:forward
  3.3 jsp:param

4. appropriate inclusion mechanism,
   "include directive <%@ include file="XXX.html" %>" or <jsp:include>

5. Java Bean (which is not EJB)
  5.1 property is determined by the naming of getter&setter,
      not from a member of a class
  5.2 For use JSPs, the property type should be a type that
      either **String** or **primitive**.
      If it isn't, it can still be a legal bean,
      but you won't be able to rely on standard actions,
      and you might have to use scripting
  5.3 must have a public & non-argument constructor

6. scripting can even be inside a standard action(even though it is bad)
   by assigning value attribute with "<%= %>"
   e.g. <jsp:setProperty name="person" property="name" value="<%= request.getParameter("userName") %>">

7. JSP EL can get direct access to the following two categories of objects
  7.1 EL Implicit objects:
      pageScope, requestScope, sessionScope, applicationScope
      param, paramValues, header, headerValues, cookie, initParam,
      pageContext
      Note, EL implicit objects are not the same as the implicit objects
  7.2 Attributes in: pageScope, requestScope, sessionScope, applicationScope

8. More about JSP EL
  8.1 if the expression has a variable followed by a dot,
      the left-hand variable must be a Map or a bean
  8.2 the thing to the right of the "." must be a map key or a bean property
  8.3 the [ ] operator is like the ".", however, the thing on the right can be a map, a bean, a list or an array
  8.4 you can use nested expressions inside the [ ] operator, which will be evaluated from the inner most
  8.5 EL renders raw text, including HTML

9. Deploying an app with static functions
  the xxx.tld(tag library descriptor) has to be somewhere within WEB-INF or one of the subdirectories

10. the taglib directive in JSP
  <%@ taglib prefix="PREFIX_NAME" uri="URI_NAME"%>
  Note that the uri should match what is defined inside the XXX.tld file

11. you can use EL inside a tag, even for tag property values.
    e.g.
    <jsp:useBean class="foo.Dog" id="myDog">
      <jsp:setProperty name="myDog" property="name" value="${list[2]}"
    </jsp;useBean>

12. EL is null-friendly. It handles unknown or null values so that the page will still display
    Even if it can't find an attribute/property/key with the name in the expression
    In arithmetic:
      EL treats null as **0**
    In logical expressions:
      EL treats null as **false**

13. Two different include mechanisms in JSP:
  their result and way of usage are often the same, however
  the include directive happens at translation time,
  <jsp:include> happens at runtime
  Note: the XXX.jsp file to be included **should not** contain <html>, <head>, <body> tags.

  13.1 the include directive: e.g. <%@ include file="Header.jsp"%>
  13.2 <jsp:include> standard action: e.g. <jsp:include page="Header.jsp">
14. <jsp:param> element can be specified in <jsp:include> directive,
    which can later on be extracted by using ${param.PARAM_NAME}
15. If the request parameter name is different from the property name,
    but you want to set the value of the property equal to the request parameter value,
    you can use the "param" attribute in the <jsp:setPorperty> tag
16. The included resource has some limitations:
    it cannot change the response status code or set headers
17. standard action: <jsp:forward page="view.jsp">

Chapter9: Custom tags are useful, using JSTL
1. JSTL: JSP Standard Tag Library
2. To use JSTL, we should put two files:
   jstl.jar & standard.jar into the WEB-INF/lib directory
3. HTML entities:
     <, &lt;
     >, &gt;
     &, &amp;
     ', &#039;
     ", &#034;

4. <c:out value='' [escapeXml='true|false'] [default='DEFAULT_OUTPUT']>,
  using the <c:out> tag can prevent cross-site hacking
  Note: cross-site hacking/scripting: the attack is sent from one user to another user's browser
        using webapp as the delivery mechanism

5. Looping without scripting: <c:forEach var=" " items="COLLECTION_VARIALBE" [varStatus=""]> LOOP_CONTENT </c:forEach>

6. It is the convention(not must) for JSTL tag's to be prefixed with then name 'c', which means "Core"

7. <c:if test="CONDITION"> </c:if>

8. JSTL does not have if/else combo,
   but it has
    <c:choose>
      <c:when test="CONDITION"> <!-- There can be multiple whens -->
      </c:when>
      ...
      <c:otherwise> <!-- Otherwise is used as a default condition -->
      </c:otherwise>
